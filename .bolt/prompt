For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

This template uses Reown AppKit for Solana wallet connections. When building components that need wallet functionality:

## Wallet Integration Rules:
1. ALWAYS use the pre-configured <appkit-button /> component for wallet connections - never create custom wallet connect buttons
2. Use wallet connection hooks from @reown/appkit/react for wallet state management (useAppKitAccount, useAppKitNetwork, etc.)
3. All Solana networks (mainnet, testnet, devnet) are pre-configured in src/config/index.tsx

## Working with App.tsx:
- The AppKit is initialized inside a useEffect hook with error handling
- Always wrap <appkit-button /> with a loading state check: {appKitInitialized ? <appkit-button /> : <div>Loading...</div>}
- When adding new components, place them after the wallet button in the existing div structure
- Use the established styling pattern with inline styles or add your preferred CSS framework

## MANDATORY WALLET BUTTON:
- ALWAYS include the <appkit-button /> component in every design, even if not explicitly mentioned in the user's request
- The wallet connection is a core feature of this template and must be present in all builds
- Position it prominently, typically near the top of the page or in a header section

## Example App.tsx modifications:
```tsx
return (
  <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center', padding: '2rem' }}>
    <h2>Your App Title</h2>
    {appKitInitialized ? (
      <>
        <appkit-button />
        {/* Add your components here */}
        <YourNewComponent />
      </>
    ) : (
      <div>Loading wallet connection...</div>
    )}
  </div>
)
```

## CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER modify files in src/config/* - these contain essential wallet configuration
- NEVER modify vite.config.ts or .env - these are core setup files
- NEVER write `package.json` directly - use npm commands to install packages if needed
- ALWAYS use <appkit-button /> for wallet connections instead of custom implementations
- NEVER move or remove the AppKit initialization logic from the useEffect hook

For icons, use any icon library you prefer. For styling, use any CSS approach you prefer (CSS modules, styled-components, Tailwind, etc.).

The wallet connection is automatically handled - focus on building great user experiences around the connected wallet state.
