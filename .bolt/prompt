For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

This template uses Reown AppKit for Solana wallet connections. When building components that need wallet functionality:

1. ALWAYS use the pre-configured <appkit-button /> component for wallet connections - never create custom wallet connect buttons
2. Use the wallet connection hooks provided by @reown/appkit/react for wallet state management
3. All Solana networks (mainnet, testnet, devnet) are pre-configured in src/config/index.tsx

CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER modify files in src/config/* - these contain essential wallet configuration
- NEVER modify vite.config.ts or .env - these are core setup files
- NEVER write `package.json` directly - use npm commands to install packages if needed
- ALWAYS use <appkit-button /> for wallet connections instead of custom implementations

For icons, use any icon library you prefer. For styling, use any CSS approach you prefer (CSS modules, styled-components, Tailwind, etc.).

The wallet connection is automatically handled - focus on building great user experiences around the connected wallet state.
